# code by Joe Meyer

# to use:
# 	load this file ("python -i krrc_helper.py") from Terminal/shell
#		make sure you're in same directory as playlist file (i.e. Downloads) AND this file (move it if necessary)
# 	call "normalize(filename, start_time, cumulative_time)"
#		- filename includes extension ('.txt' recommended) and refers to playlist/tracklist file
# 		- start_time is tuple(hours, minutes) [24 hour time] (see example below)
#		- cumulative_time indicates playlist time (if True) or individual song lengths (if False)
#			boolean
#			False by default
# 		ex: "normalize(file_name = 'playlist.txt', start_time = (15, 25), cumulative_time = True)"
# 			this creates new file 'playlist_normalized.txt' with normalized times
#			in this example start time is 15:25 [3:25 pm] and song times refer to location in playlist, not individual song lengths

# input file: file of format:
# 	"artist - song - time"
# 	new line separating each song
# 	ex: "AIR - Lucky and Unhappy - 00:00
# 		 Depeche Mode - People are People - 4:31
#		 Daft Punk - Technologic - 08:24" [cumulative_time]
#	  OR
#		"AIR - Lucky and Unhappy - 04:31
# 		 Depeche Mode - People are People - 3:53
#		 Daft Punk - Technologic - 4:44" [not cumulative_time]
#	IMPORTANT: lines must be exactly correct format
#		space or tab or dash followed directly by time followed directly by line break
#			time format: "[minutes]:[seconds]" (see example above)
#	'.doc' may not work; I recommend '.txt' extension for input file

# output: writes new file "[filename]_normalized.[extension]"
# 	same format, but times normalized to cumulative format from start time
#		24 hour time
